This script is a project that was done ahead of the 2022 World Cup. The purpose of this project was to see if there was a way to make sports betting less dangerous
for those who do not have the proper data to make the best prediction. I used machine learning and data engineering on my dataset in order to clean up the data,
create new features, find relations in features and apply K-Nearest-Neighbors on the features to predict the outcome of a match based on historical world cup matches.
